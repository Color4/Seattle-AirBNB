## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using AirBNB data of Boston and Seattle to better understand:  
1. Comparing the trend of prices in Boston and Seattle; Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle? 
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike? 
3. How many listings are there for each neighborhood? How can we characterize each neighborhood?
4. How to divide the reviews into positive group and negative group according to sentiment analysis of the comments?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found in the notebook.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
