# Seattle and Boston-AirBNB dataset analysis
For this project, I was interestested in using AirBNB data of Boston and Seattle to better understand:  
(1) Comparing the trend of prices in Boston and Seattle; Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle? 
(2)  What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike? 
(3) How many listings are there for each neighborhood? How can we characterize each neighborhood?
(4) How to divide the reviews into positive group and negative group according to sentiment analysis of the comments?
