# Seattle and Boston-AirBNB dataset analysis
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:  How other developers suggested breaking into the field (what education to pursue)? What factors about an individual contributed to salary? How bias played a role in the suggestions of developers for how to break into the field? What was the state of bootcamps for assisting individuals with breaking into developer roles? How were bootcamps assisting with increasing diversity in tech careers? The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here. However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.
